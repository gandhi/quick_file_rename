# Filename Replaces

Say I have a folder with the following contents:

```
hello.py
fun.txt
wowthisisaMARK.mp3
coolsongnameMARK.mp3
ihatethisMARK.mp3
```

and we want to remove the `MARK` from all the file names.

```
> python script.py current/directory/path
```

and following the prompts will clean up your directory as desired.
